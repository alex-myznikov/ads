This package provides an implementation of computer science algorithms and data structures with strong types and full test coverage and should be beneficial for those who uses [TypeScript](https://alex-myznikov.gitbook.io/adsjs/getting-started/ts) as their primary superset language for projects on JavaScript. Though it is also supplied with builds for [Node.js](https://alex-myznikov.gitbook.io/adsjs/getting-started/nodejs), [ES Modules](https://alex-myznikov.gitbook.io/adsjs/getting-started/esmodules) and traditional [bundles for browsers](https://alex-myznikov.gitbook.io/adsjs/getting-started/browsers).
