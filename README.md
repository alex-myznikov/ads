# ADSJS - algorithms and data structures for JavaScript and TypeScript

This package provides an implementation of computer science algorithms and data structures with strong types and full test coverage and should be beneficial for those who uses [TypeScript](https://alex-myznikov.gitbook.io/adsjs/getting-started/ts) as their primary superset language for projects on JavaScript. Though it is also supplied with builds for [Node.js](https://alex-myznikov.gitbook.io/adsjs/getting-started/nodejs), [ES Modules](https://alex-myznikov.gitbook.io/adsjs/getting-started/esmodules) and traditional [bundles for browsers](https://alex-myznikov.gitbook.io/adsjs/getting-started/browsers).
